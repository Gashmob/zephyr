Strongly opinionated styles and components library.

Made first for my own usage but also made to be used anywhere in any context.

The whole package can be used by only importing `@gashmob/zephyr`. But sub-packages are also available to import only what you need. For almost each parts of this documentation, you can retrieve at the top of it the name of its corresponding sub package.
