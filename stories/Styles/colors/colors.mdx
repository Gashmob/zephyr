# Colors

#### `@gashmob/zephyr/colors`

## Theme colors

These colors can be customized via [theming](/?path=/docs/styles-colors--docs#theming). They are dark/light mode responsive using the attribute `data-dark-mode` on body tag.

You can switch between dark/light mode and different themes using the 2 selectors on top of this page (they are on `system` and `default` by default).

<Canvas of={ColorsStories.ThemeColorsStory}></Canvas>

## Common colors

Each of these colors can be used via the variable `--zr-color-{color_name}-{darkness}`.
A lot inspired from [Tailwind colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors), they are great so no need to reinvent the wheel.

## Theming

You can customize theme colors by overriding CSS variables values. For that you need to include the following snippet after Zephyr imports:

```scss
:root {
  // Here you define all colors variables presented in first table
}

@mixin dark-colors {
  // And here their dark mode variant
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body[data-dark-mode=system] {
    @include dark-colors;
  }
}

body[data-dark-mode=dark] {
  @include dark-colors;
}
```

There is already some pre-defined theme which can be used by importing `@gashmob/zephyr/theme/{name}`:
- default
