# Colors

#### `@gashmob/zephyr/colors`

## Theme colors

These colors can be customized via [theming](/?path=/docs/styles-colors--docs#theming). They are dark/light mode responsive.

<Canvas of={ColorsStories.ThemeColorsStory}></Canvas>

## Common colors

Each of these colors can be used via the variable `--zr-color-{color_name}-{darkness}`.
A lot inspired from [Tailwind colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors), they are great so no need to reinvent the wheel.
